TS is superset of js
every js file is a valid ts file
TS has -
//static typing - type of variable must be known at compile time, in constrast dynamic typed languages are where type is determined at runtime and also the type of variables can change dynamically
//code completion
//refractoring
//shorthand notations
Transpilation- ts compiler converts the ts file to js

//tsc -v   ->check version
tsc index.ts  -> compler ts file into js file
tsc --init ->create tscconfig file
